This is a course for first year undergrads learning about mathematical proofs.

To work using Lean, you either have to install Lean locally, use Codespaces or use Gitpod.

* To use codespaces, make sure you're logged in to Github, click the button below, select `4-core`, and then press `Create codespace`. After a few minutes an editor with Lean working will open in your browser.

* Gitpod is very similar to Codespaces, click the button below, press `Continue` and wait a few minutes.
